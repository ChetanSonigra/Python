# type conversion:
# you can convert int to float, float to int, int to complex, float to complex
# can't convert complex to other.

# type casting:
# int(): constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
# float(): constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
# str(): constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals
